# Temperature-Coral-Bleaching-Database

The .xlsx file named databaseREADME includes a Column Name, Description and Instructions on how each column of the database was populated for all entries.

The .R files are the scripts used to complete the analyses.

The unfilteredDatabase.csv file includes all entries before _a priori_ filtering for use in 1_doseResponse_dbFiltering.R script.

The filteredDatabase.csv file is generated by the 1_doseResponse_dbFiltering.R script, and has been included here for use with 2_doseResponse_mergeCountParse.R

The 2_doseResponse_mergeCountParse.R script merges the heating metrics from the heatingParameterCalculation.R output (heatingParams_HeatedObs_toMerge.csv) with the filtered database, removes outlying observations, counts the remaining observations and parses into smaller datasets for downstream analyses:          
   - 3_doseResponse_RespVarStats.R, for figures and stats of control vs. heated observation of response variables
   - 4_doseResponse_fits.R, for figures and stats of hormetic fits of heated observations vs. heating metrics
   - 5_doseResponse_MHWcomparison.R for a comparison of laboratory vs. marine heatwave observations (MHW datafiles are large, please email for access)
